Croatia has some incredible coastal scenery, but in my experience, it
was not the most enjoyable place to travel by bike. After spending more
than a month in the country, I tried to collect a few retrospective
thoughts and tips about bike touring in Croatia. As I mostly cycled on
the Adriatic coast and islands, they may not apply to the more quiet and
slightly cooler inland areas.

It certainly did not help that I visited the country during the peak
tourist season in August. I can well imagine that Croatia becomes more
enjoyable for bicycle touring in the mid-season in spring or autumn. It
was 2020 though, and I can not picture what previous summers looked
like. But in case you still decide to go in summer, here are a few tips
on how to survive the Mediterranean heat, heavy motorized traffic and
mass tourism.

## Cycling in the summer\'s heat

When arriving in Croatia in early August, I was surprised by the heat. I
failed to cycle up minor hills and got dehydration headaches,
culminating the day I got food poisoned on [Krk
Island](http://cyclingho.me/cycling-about-croatias-krk-island/). After a
few days though, I caught up habits that made cycling in the sun a lot
more enjoyable. I try to list them out here.

-   My top advice to resist the heat is to always cycle a little slower
    than you normally would. In this way you will sweat less and save a
    lot of water.
-   Always carry a lot of water. Along the coast, fountains are rare and
    springs virtually absent. I often stopped in bars and restaurants to
    refill my bottles.
-   Cycle in the morning. Temperatures typically rise until noon, and
    stay high for the rest of the day. But in late afternoon, the sun
    gets lower and there is often a slight breeze.
-   Get wet as often as you can. I bathed every 10 km at least, and did
    not wait to dry to start cycling again. Some even say that seawater
    is good for your skin.
-   Wear long sleeves and trousers. This may feel uncomfortable at
    first, but again, the clothes will help you keep moisture on your
    body instead of sweating up your water reserves.
-   Plan smaller distances. I often had a long break in mid-day, or
    cycled very slowly. Besides, you may discover that going slowly is
    also good for the mind.

## Surviving motorized traffic

I thought the worst part of cycling in Croatia was motorized traffic.
Croatia is not bike friendly at all. Bike lanes are a rarity and bike
roads inexistent. Except for some gangs of old men ringing their bicycle
bells at pedestrians on city sidewalks, cyclists are very few, be it
bike tourists, road cyclists or city commuters.

In my experience, traffic was worst along the coastline between Rijeka
and Zadar (including the busy islands of
[Krk](http://cyclingho.me/cycling-about-croatias-krk-island/) and
[Pag](http://cyclingho.me/cycling-on-pag-island-and-to-zadar/)) and
between
[Split](http://cyclingho.me/cycling-and-city-tourism-in-central-dalmatia/)
and
[Dubrovnik](http://cyclingho.me/cycling-along-the-southern-dalmatian-seashore/)
(airport), and on. Traffic was still intense between Zadar and Split but
I felt that drivers were more careful there. I have never driven a car,
but I believe the following rules helped me to survive the heavy
traffic:

-   Cycle minor roads wherever possible. These are often incredibly
    empty, and the earned peace of mind will be well worth the hills and
    detours.
-   Go slowly and take breaks. Croatian traffic and dehydration or
    tiredness do not go well along. Be sure to keep enough energy to
    handle incoming cars.
-   Get a rearview mirror. It can be mentally tiring to keep an eye on
    it, but the mirror will let you watch for cars approaching too fast
    or too close.
-   Take space on the road. Paradoxically, this yields most cars to
    instinctively slow down and overtake more securely. On the opposite,
    cycling along the shoulder always resulted in motor vehicles
    overtaking dangerously close and fast, as if I was just a lifeless
    obstacle.
-   If you use drop handlebars, avoid putting your hands on the top bar
    while in busy traffic, as this position will make you more
    vulnerable to being blown off the road.
-   When vehicle shows no intention to slow down or keep distance, grab
    the handlebar firmly and bend down. This will give you more
    resistance to the blow and more force to handle the bike swinging in
    the eddies.
-   Of course, wear a helmet and proper lightning at night.

## Avoiding mass tourism

Croatia felt a lot like the Southeast Asia of Europe. Since the
country\'s independence from Yougoslavia and the end of the communist
rule, many industries have closed, and the economy of Croatia has almost
entirely relied on tourism. Between the oil refineries of Rijeka and the
port of Polƒçe, I saw very little agriculture and not a single factory.
Unfortunately bicycle tourism does not appear to be part of this grand
plan, the country instead promoting a more destructive form of tourism
involving camping-cars, boat tours, capitalized natural sites and a lot
of grilled meat.

Prices of cafes and restaurants are widely variable. For coffees I paid
anything between 7 and 25 kunas (1 and 3.5 euros). I first pictured
Croatia as a rich country, before understanding that prices are aimed at
foreign customers and often unaffordable to the locals. Most people I
met worked in the tourism industry, and I could not believe how most of
them complained how few tourists there were, while my feeling was that
beaches, roads, and cities were overwhelmed with tourists. It seemed
that people worked very long hours in summer in order to make up for the
rest of the year. Most everybody I met were professional in their jobs,
but I had a hard time having deeper conversations with the locals.

-   Certainly the best advice to avoid the crowds is to visit Croatia
    anytime but during summer, which will also spare you of the heat
    and, I expect, much of the coastal car traffic.
-   Avoid large-scale camp sites. They are often soulless, totally
    impersonal, designed as camping-car parking space rather than
    camping space, and very largely overpriced (prices comparable or
    above Switzerland).
-   On the other hand, there exist smaller, often older campsites,
    pricing around 50 kn per person. I often found those in the suburbs
    of secondary coastal towns, never far from the beaches.
-   Wild camping is punishable by law but generally practised, including
    by locals who are less likely to get fined for it. If you do wild
    camp in Croatia though, please carry your trash and bury human
    waste. The country is enough of a thrash dump as it is.
