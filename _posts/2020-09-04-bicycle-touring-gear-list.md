<!-- FIXME gear image header -->

This is the gear I currently carry along while cycling east across
Europe. It sums up to roughly 15 kg for the bike and 25 kg of luggage.
This is on the heavy side especially for summer touring but I like to
have a bit of comfort, and make stops to work along the way. Items in
*italics* are those I acquired on tour and those ~~crossed-out~~ were
discarded or sent back. I will try to keep the list updated as I
continue my travels eastwards. Feel free to ask for more personal advice
in the comments section.

## The cyclist

France-made, 33-years old. Can speaking multiple languages. Weights
around 65 kg but tends to become lighter when given poisoned foods.
Beginning to wear out after being used on a bunch of other bike tours.
Sadly the brain is permanently damaged after trying to be a scientist
for ten years (Permanent Head Damage syndrome), but appears to be
non-replaceable. Other parts are basically still functional.

## Bike and bags

After multiple tours on cheap or second-hand bicycles, I finally
purchased a Surly LHT and I am very happy with it. After about 6000 km
of travel and a few day tours and commutes, all components are still
original except for the saddle (swapped for a Brooks in
[Zurich](http://cyclingho.me/taking-a-break-in-zurich/)), the tires
(replaced by Schwalbe Marathon in
[Zadar](http://cyclingho.me/cycling-on-pag-island-and-to-zadar/)), and
one (yes) tube punctured in
[Ljubljana](http://cyclingho.me/cycling-through-the-julian-alps-and-slovenia/).
Surly makes some of the most conservative touring bikes around, which
has pros and cons (26 inch on rocky paths is shaky). The bike is
particularly long, giving it stability (and less manoeuvrability) and a
special feel that always made me want to go on a tour when grabbing it
for short commutes.

I use a four-pannier set-up, which is what the LHT is build for, but
sometimes think how replacing the front panniers with a 40 litre
backpack would allow for longer hikes. It would put more weight on the
rear wheel though.

## Camping gear

My camping gear is lightweight because I have also used it on hikes.
Some may prefer to carry a bit more for extra tent space. I prefer
quilts to sleeping bags mostly for the comfort of not waking up all
squeezed in a swirling bag in the middle of the night. Apparently I roll
around a lot at night\... I use bells as extra safety against theft and
curious animals.

## Clothes

I certainly carry more clothes than necessary and could save a bit of
weight there. But then I am not always cycling and like to have a bit of
change when stopping for a few days in town. I also carry some (not so)
cold weather clothes which, I think, should allow for comfortable
cycling and camping down to at least freezing when the autumn arrives.

I have cleating shoes but do not find them so useful, and sometimes
regret not being able to go for longer hikes. For this, I thought of
giving up on my cycling shoes and get a more versatile pair of trekking
shoes. Also for the last 1000 km along the Adriatic coastline, I have
not used my cycling shoes at all, and always cycled in sandals instead
to be ready for a quick swim. My sandals did not really like the
seawater though and I will probably need to replace them some time.

necessarily included in the above list, such as my best friend and
mountain pass mascot which you may have spotted on some of the photos.
