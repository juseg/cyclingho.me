# Welcome

This is a blog about my cycling tour from Lille to Anafi last year, soon-to-be
expanded with small stories from other cycling tours in Europe, North America
and Japan.

**Note:** I am currently migrating from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The new design is based on the Jekyll theme
[Sleek](https://janczizikow.github.io/sleek/). Picture galleries are down for
now but a photoset corresponding to each post can be found in my
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyjeo/collections/72157715425207308/)
collection. It may take me a little while to get things up and running.
